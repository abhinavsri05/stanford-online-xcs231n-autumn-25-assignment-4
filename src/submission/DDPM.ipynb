        "\n",
        "So far, we have explored discriminative models, which are trained to produce a labeled output. These range from straightforward image classification to sentence generation where the problem was still framed as classification, with labels in vocabulary space and a recurrence mechanism capturing multi-word labels. Now, we will expand our repertoire by building a generative model capable of creating novel images that resemble a given set of training images.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are many types of generative models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), autoregressive models, normalizing flow models, and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), all of which can synthesize striking images. However, in 2020, Ho et al. introduced Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by combining diffusion probabilistic models with denoising score matching. This resulted in a generative model that is both simple to train and powerful enough to generate complex, high-quality images. The following provides a high-level overview of DDPMs. For more details, please refer to the course slides and the original DDPM paper [1].\n",

        "# Forward Process\n",
        "Let $q(x_0)$ be the distribution of clean dataset images. We define a forward noising process as a Markov chain of small noising steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$q(x_t | x_{t-1}) \\sim N(x_t; \\sqrt{1-\\beta_t} x_{t-1} , \\beta_t I)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where the stepwise variance $(\\beta_1, ..., \\beta_T)$ determines the noise schedule. Due to the properties of Gaussian distributions, we can express $q(x_t | x_0)$ in closed form as:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$q(x_t | x_0) \\sim N(x_t; \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t} x_0 , (1-\\bar{\\alpha}_t) I)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $\\alpha_t = 1-\\beta_t$ and $\\bar{\\alpha}_t = \\prod_{s=1}^{t}\\alpha_t$.\n",
        "If the noise schedule $(\\beta_1, ..., \\beta_T)$ is set properly, the final distribution $q(x_T)$ becomes indistinguishable from pure Gaussian noise $N(0, I)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Recall that sampling from a Gaussian distribution $x \\sim N(\\mu, \\sigma^2)$ is equivalent to computing $\\sigma * \\epsilon + \\mu$ where $\\epsilon \\sim N(0, 1)$. Hence, sampling from $q(x_t | x_{t-1})$ or $q(x_t | x_0)$ is straightforward given $x_{t-1}$ or $x_0$ respectively. Because of this, the forward process is simple and does not require learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Reverse Process\n",
        "The reverse process reconstructs a clean image $x_0$ from pure noise $x_T$ through multiple steps. Let $p(x_{t-1} | x_t)$ denote the reverse step of $q(x_t | x_{t-1})$.\n",
        "The first key insight is that learning to reverse each individual denoising step is easier than reversing the entire forward process in one go. In other words, learning $p(x_{t-1} | x_t)$ for each $t$ is easier than directly learning $p(x_0 | x_T)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, learning $p(x_{t-1} | x_t)$ is still challenging. Although $q(x_t | x_{t-1})$ is Gaussian, $p(x_{t-1} | x_t)$ could take any complex form and is almost certainly not Gaussian. Modeling and sampling from an arbitrary distribution is significantly harder than working with a simple parametric distribution like a Gaussian.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second key insight is that if the stepwise noise $\\beta_t$ in the forward process is small enough, then the reverse step $p(x_{t-1} | x_t)$ is also close to a Gaussian distribution. Thus, we only need to estimate its mean and variance. In practice, setting the variance of $p(x_{t-1} | x_t)$ to match $\\beta_t$ (the same as in the forward step) works well. Consequently, learning the reverse process reduces to learning the mean $\\mu(x_t, t; \\theta)$ where $\\theta$ represents the parameters of a neural network.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Denoising Objective\n",
        "Generative models are optimized by minimizing the expected negative log-likelihood $\\mathbb{E}[-\\log{p_\\theta(x_0)}]$ of the dataset samples. The likelihood of each sample can be expressed as: $p_\\theta(x_0) = p(x_T)\\prod_{t=1}^T p(x_{t-1} | x_t)$. Since this objective is intractable in many cases, various classes of generative models optimize the variational lower bound on the negative log-likelihood.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ho et al. demonstrated that this objective is equivalent to minimizing the following denoising loss\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\\mathbb{E}_{t, x_0, \\epsilon}\\left[ \\| \\epsilon - \\epsilon_\\theta (\\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}x_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\epsilon, t ) \\|^2 \\right]$$\n",
        "\n",
        "where $t$ is uniform between 1 and T, $x_0$ is clean sample, $\\epsilon$ is sampled from standard gaussian $N(0, I)$, and $\\epsilon_\\theta$ is a neural network model trained to predict the noise $\\epsilon$ from the input noisy sample $x_t = \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}x_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\epsilon$. In other words, $\\epsilon_\\theta$ learns to denoise the input noisy image. Note that this is equivalent to predicting the clean sample, since the noise can be recovered from the noisy image and the clean sample following the equation $x_t = \\sqrt{\\bar{\\alpha}_t}x_0 + \\sqrt{1 - \\bar{\\alpha}_t} \\epsilon$.\n",

        "\n",
        "Now that we have defined the forward process, let's define the UNet model for denoising the input image. UNet is a neural network architecture designed for image-to-image tasks like segmentation, style transfer, etc. It consists of an encoder (or downsampling module) that transforms the input image into hierarchical features with decreasing spatial resolution and increasing feature dimensions. The decoder (or upsampling module) then upsamples the features by progressively restoring the spatial resolution, mirroring the encoder's structure. At each decoder layer, features from the corresponding encoder layer are concatenated, providing a direct pathway for finer details. This approach reduces the burden on the bottleneck layers, allowing them to focus on capturing high-level representations rather than memorizing fine details.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will use UNet in this case because both our input and output are aligned images with same dimensions: C x H x W. Each ResNet block in the UNet will also take an additional input vector called context for conditioning. We will generate the context vector by encoding the diffusion timestep and text-prompt.\n",
        "\n",
        "Run the cell below to get a rough outline of the UNet architecture. Each red box represents a ResNet block containing 2 or 3 convolutional layers that maintain the spatial resolution of the feature maps. The context vector input to every ResNet block is ommitted for clarity. The shape written below each box indicates the output tensor shape after that block. Additional arrows illustrate the skip connections, which enable the U-Net to preserve fine-grained details in the output. For example, the output of `layer1_block1` with shape (d, h, w) will be concatenated with the output of `layer4_block1`, also with shape (d, h, w), before being passed to `layer4_block2`. Therefore, `layer4_block2` will receive an input of shape (2*d, h, w)."

        "Generative models are typically evaluated on fidelity (i.e., the quality or realism of the generated samples) and diversity (the variability or coverage of the sample space). For conditional generative models, fidelity additionally refers to how faithfully the generated samples adhere to the input conditions. These two metrics are often in tension with each other, leading to a trade-off between them. Ho et al. introduced a simple technique called classifier-free guidance [3], which allows explicit control over this trade-off.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In classifier-free guidance, during the training of a conditional diffusion model $\\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t, c)$ , the condition $c$ is randomly dropped (i.e. replaced with $c=\\phi$) with some probability (typically 0.1 to 0.2). During each denoising step of sampling, the prediction is updated as:\n",
        "$$\\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t, c) \\leftarrow (w+1) \\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t, c) - w \\epsilon_\\theta(x_t, t, \\phi)$$\n",
        "where $w$ is a positive scalar (the guidance scale). In other words, we perform two predictions during each denoising step, one conditional and one unconditional, and combine them linearly to favor the conditional generation. $w$ is a hyperparameter that is tuned to optimize a model-specific evaluation metric. A higher $w$ makes the generations more faithful to the condition but tends to reduce their diversity.\n",
