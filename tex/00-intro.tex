\section{Goals}

In this assignment, you will implement language networks and apply them to image captioning on the COCO dataset. Then you will be introduced to self-supervised learning to automatically learn the visual representations of an unlabeled dataset.

The goals of this assignment are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement and understand diffusion models (DDPMs) and apply them to image generation.
    \item Implement and understand CLIP and DINO, two self-supervised learning methods that leverage large amounts of unlabeled data to learn visual representations.
\end{itemize}

All notebooks require GPU. To save GPU usage time, we recommend you develop and debug your code without GPU first. Then you can run the code with GPU to get the final results.

Please refer to the \texttt{README.md} file in the assignment directory for GPU environment setup.
